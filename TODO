== TODO ==
- Chop rails_root from inline-partial-edit-mode's partial names
- Use <div> instead of <!-- --> for inline-partial-edit-mode?  May allow for folding.
- Remove indentation from partials during create-partial-from-selection
- Add indentation to partials when entering inline-partial-edit-mode
- Add indentation to erb fragment that replaces the partials after create-partial-from-selection
- Fix inline-partial mode for rjs files (<!-- style comments don't work well in ruby code)

- List common rake tasks in a pop-up menu and execute? db_schema_import db_schema_dump migrate
- Jump to environment.rb, database.yml
