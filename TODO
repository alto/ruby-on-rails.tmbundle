== TODO ==
- Let RailsPath recognize application.rb as a controller
- Remove extraneous dirname from setting each RUBYLIB -- remove from plugins too?
- License for footnotes?
- Chop rails_root from inline-partial-edit-mode's partial names
- Use <div> instead of <!-- --> for inline-partial-edit-mode?  May allow for folding.
- Remove indentation from partials during create-partial-from-selection
- Add indentation to partials when entering inline-partial-edit-mode
- Add indentation to erb fragment that replaces the partials after create-partial-from-selection
- Intelligent Go To File needs to look for rxml and rjs files
  - pop up window asking for filename on create (if view doesn't exist, for example)
- Fix inline-partial mode for rjs files (<!-- style comments don't work well in ruby code)
